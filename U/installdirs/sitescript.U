?S:sitescript:
?S:	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
?S:	to put add-on publicly executable files for the package in question.  It
?S:	is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/bin. Programs using
?S:	this variable must be prepared to deal with ~name substitution.
?S:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?S:	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
?S:	scripts in this directory with
?S:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL
?S:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.
?S:.
?S:sitescriptexp:
?S:	This is the same as the sitescript variable, but is filename expanded at
?S:	configuration time, for use in your makefiles.
?S:.
?S:installsitescript:
?S:	This variable is usually the same as sitescriptexp, unless you are on
?S:	a system running AFS, in which case they may differ slightly. You
?S:	should always use this variable within your makefiles for portability.
